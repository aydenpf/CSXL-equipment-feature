# Equipment Reservation System

### Team D9:

David Sprague, Nick Mountain, Jacob Brown, Ayden Franklin

### Overview:

To permit the use of CSXL equipment that will be avaiable in the future, students must be able to veiw availability of equipment and request equipment. Managers and ambassadoors must be able to see requests and accept them and ensure equipment was used properly.

### Key Personas:

##### Sally Student:

Sally student needs to be able to reserve and check out equipment.

##### Amy Ambassador:

Amy ambassador needs to be able to oversee chekouts, returns, and condition of equipment.

### User Stories

#### Sally Student:

As Sally Student, I need to be able to see what equipment is available for me to reserve and checkout available equipment. I also need to sign a liability waiver the first time I checkout equipment.

#### Amy Ambassador

As Amy Ambassador, I need to check to make sure I am giving equipment to the correct students who reserved them, check the equipment out, and check it back in when it is returned. I also need to keep track of how the condition of the equipment changes between checkout and checkin. I need to be able to uniquely identify each piece of equipment and track which students have which pieces of equipment. I also need to see students' checkout histories, to track for a history of late returns and/or disrespect of equipment.
