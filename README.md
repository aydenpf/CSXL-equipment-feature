# CSXL Equipment Feature

### Description
<p>Worked in a team of 4 to add equipment reservation functionality to UNC's Computer Science Experience Labs student resource. We built our feature using the existing functionality of the open source codebase. We implemented a three-tiered architecture to create a persistent application. A user is able to see all available equipment and checkout equipment. An ambassador of the lab is able to confirm and manage checkout requests and current checkouts. The feature was made using:</p>
<ul>
  <li>REST APIs with FastAPI</li>
  <li>The Angular framework and angular material components</li>
  <li>The Docker development environment</li>
  <li>Git branches, rebasing, and merging using git industry practices.</li>
  <li>Peer programming, pull requests, and code reviews</li>
  <li>SQL, PostresQL, SQLalchemy for database concerns</li>
</ul>
